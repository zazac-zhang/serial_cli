//! Task scheduler module
//!
//! This module provides task scheduling and execution.
//!
//! # Key types
//!
//! - [`Task`] — a unit of work with a unique ID and creation timestamp
//! - [`TaskType`] — the kind of work (script execution, serial operation, custom)
//! - [`TaskStatus`] — lifecycle state of a task
//! - [`TaskResult`] — outcome of task execution
//! - [`TaskQueue`] — priority-based queue with concurrency limiting
