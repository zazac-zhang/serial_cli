# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Serial CLI is a Rust-based serial port communication tool with embedded LuaJIT scripting, optimized for AI/automation workflows. It supports multiple protocols (Modbus RTU/ASCII, AT Commands, line-based, and custom Lua protocols) with structured JSON output.

Includes a Tauri-based GUI application (`src-tauri/` + `frontend/`).

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Development build
just dev          # cargo build

# Release build
just build        # cargo build --release

# Run tests
just test         # cargo test
just test-verbose # cargo test -- --nocapture

# Code quality
just check        # fmt-check + lint + test (all checks)
just fmt          # cargo fmt
just lint         # cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run application
just run <args>   # cargo run -- <args>

# Cross-compilation
just build-all    # Linux + macOS + Windows
just build-linux  # x86_64 + aarch64
just build-macos  # x86_64 + arm64
```

**Requirements:** Rust 1.75+, just task runner

## Architecture

See [`docs/dev/ARCH.md`](docs/dev/ARCH.md) for full directory layout, design patterns, module dependencies, and data flow.

**Quick reference:**

- `src/main.rs` — thin entry point (~73 lines), dispatches to `cli/commands/*`
- `src/cli/args.rs` — clap definitions (Cli, Commands)
- `src/cli/types.rs` — command enum definitions (all subcommands)
- `src/cli/commands/` — one handler file per command group
- `src/serial_core/` — port I/O, sniffer, virtual ports
- `src/protocol/` — protocol engine with Lua extensibility
- `src/lua/` — LuaJIT integration (bindings, stdlib, executor)
- `src/config.rs` — TOML-based ConfigManager

## Key Conventions

- **Error handling**: Use `Result<T>` from `error.rs`
- **Async**: All I/O uses `tokio`
- **Lua integration**: Scripts executed via LuaEngine
- **Configuration**: TOML-based with fallback defaults
- **Documentation**: Keep docs minimal and well-organized
  - Root level: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, RELEASE.md (essential user-facing docs)
  - Architecture: `docs/dev/ARCH.md` (directory layout, design patterns)
  - Avoid creating new .md files unless they serve a clear, ongoing purpose
- **TODO tracking**: 发现或修复问题后，同步更新 `docs/user/TODO.md` 中的待办/已完成列表。

## GUI Subproject

Tauri-based GUI in `src-tauri/` (workspace member) with React frontend in `frontend/`:

```bash
just gui-deps           # Install frontend dependencies
just gui-dev            # Start Tauri dev server
just gui-build          # Build GUI application
just gui-check          # cargo check --workspace
just gui-type-check     # TypeScript type check
just gui-fmt            # Format all code
```
